# CCNA 1 Study Hub

Independent study tools for the Cisco NetAcad Introduction to Networks v7.0 (ITNv7 / CCNA 1) curriculum. Everything runs in the browser, no server, no build step, no dependencies.

## What's inside

| File | Tool | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `index.html` | Hub | Landing page with tool overview, progress stats, and resources |
| `quiz.html` | Final Exam Quiz | 143-question pool, randomized 60 per round, study/exam/retry modes, 1:15:00 timer |
| `trainer.html` | Packet Tracer Trainer | IOS CLI scenarios, VLSM addressing tables, and a full PTSA exam simulator |

The three HTML files share a consistent NetAcad-green design and a common `localStorage` key (`ccna1_hub_stats`) so the hub can show your progress across tools.

## Running it

**Locally:** open `index.html` in any modern browser.

**GitHub Pages:** push the repo, enable Pages on the `main` branch at `/ (root)`, and the hub is live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Features

### Quiz (`quiz.html`)

- Pool of 143 unique questions combining Practice Final + Final Exam content
- Each round randomly picks 60 questions with shuffled answer options
- Three modes:
  - **Study** — instant feedback with explanation after each answer
  - **Exam** — 1:15:00 timer, no feedback until the end, 70% pass threshold (42/60)
  - **Retry wrongs** — only the questions you got wrong previously
- Questions stay in English (to match the real exam), UI toggles NL/EN
- Flag questions for review, navigate with the chip bar, pause the timer

### Trainer (`trainer.html`)

- **CLI tab** — scenario-based IOS command practice with a working terminal emulator. Real IOS-style tab completion (only completes keywords, never parameter values), prefix matching across multiple tokens, and a `^` marker on syntax errors that mirrors the real router's output.
- **Adrestabel tab** — fill-in VLSM addressing tables with inline validation.
- **Examen tab** — full PTSA simulation with randomized variants across three phases:
  1. Address table (IPv4 + IPv6 + link-local)
  2. Router CLI configuration with credentials, SSH, and dual-stack interfaces
  3. Switch CLI configuration with management VLAN

  Each phase shows the relevant credentials and a compact address mini-table in the sidebar so you don't have to switch tabs while typing CLI commands.

### Hub (`index.html`)

- Summary of your last quiz score, quizzes completed, CLI scenarios done, and pending wrongs
- Links to both tools and external resources (NetAcad, Packet Tracer)
- Option to clear all local data

## Design notes

- **System fonts only.** No Google Fonts, no external CSS, no CDN dependencies. Pages render the same offline as online.
- **Single-file deliverables.** Each HTML file is self-contained: HTML + CSS + JS + base64-encoded Cisco device icons. No build step or bundler.
- **Compact icon storage.** Icons are stored once and referenced via placeholders that are expanded at render time, keeping `trainer.html` around 230 KB instead of bloating it with duplicated base64 strings.

## Privacy

No cookies, no analytics, no tracking, no third-party requests. The entire hub runs client-side with system fonts only, nothing is loaded from external CDNs or font services. Progress data and language preference are stored exclusively in the browser's `localStorage` under three keys:

- `ccna1_hub_stats` — session stats (scores, counters, timestamps)
- `ccna1_wrongs` — questions you got wrong, for the retry mode
- `ccna1_lang` — your chosen UI language

No data leaves the device. The "Reset all local data" link on the hub clears everything.
